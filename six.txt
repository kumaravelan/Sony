you have that is not in the remote repository up, or you can ask Git to fetch differences down from the other repo.

You can do this any time you are online, it does not have to correspond with a commit or anything else. Generally you will do a number of commits locally, then fetch data from the online shared repository you cloned the project from to get up to date, merge any new work into the stuff you did, then push your changes back up.

In a nutshell you can update your project with git fetch and share your changes with git push. You can manage your remote repositories with git remote.
docs   book git remote list, add and delete remote repository aliases

Unlike centralized version control systems that have a client that is very different from a server, Git repositories are all basically equal and you simply synchronize between them. This makes it easy to have more than one remote repository - you can have some that you have read-only access to and others that you can write to as well.

So that you don't have to use the full URL of a remote repository every time you want to synchronize with it, Git stores an alias or nickname for each remote repository URL you are interested in. You use the git remote command to manage this list of remote repos that you care about.
git remote list your remote aliases

Without any arguments, Git will simply show you the remote repository aliases that it has stored. By default, if you cloned the project (as opposed to creating a new one locally), Git will automatically add the URL of the repository that you cloned from under the name 'origin'. If you run the command with the -v option, you can see the actual URL for each alias.

$ git remote
origin
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:schacon/git-reference.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:schacon/git-reference.git (push)

You see the URL there twice because Git allows you to have different push and fetch URLs for each remote in case you want to use different protocols for reads and writes.
git remote add add a new remote repository of your project

If you want to share a locally created repository, or you want to take contributions from someone elses repository - if you want to interact in any way with a new repository, it's generally easiest to add it as a remote. You do that by running git remote add [alias] [url]. That adds [url] under a local remote named [alias].

For example, if we want to share our Hello World program with the world, we can create a new repository on a server (I'll use GitHub as an example), which should give you a URL, in this case "git@github.com:schacon/hw.git". To add that to our project so we can push to it and fetch updates from it we would do this:

$ git remote
$ git remote add github git@github.com:schacon/hw.git
$ git remote -v
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (fetch)
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (push)

Like the branch naming, remote alias names are arbitrary - just as 'master' has no special meaning but is widely used because git init sets it up by default, 'origin' is often used as a remote name because git clone sets it up by default as the cloned-from URL. In this case I've decided to name my remote 'github', but I could have really named it just about anything.
git remote rm removing an existing remote alias

Git addeth and Git taketh away. If you need to remove a remote - you are not using it anymore, the project is gone, etc - you can remove it with git remote rm [alias].

$ git remote -v
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (fetch)
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (push)
$ git remote add origin git://github.com/pjhyett/hw.git
$ git remote -v
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (fetch)
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (push)
origin	git://github.com/pjhyett/hw.git (fetch)
origin	git://github.com/pjhyett/hw.git (push)
$ git remote rm origin
$ git remote -v
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (fetch)
github	git@github.com:schacon/hw.git (push)

In a nutshell with git remote you can list our remote repositories and whatever URL that repository is using. You can use git remote add to add new remotes and git remote rm to delete existing ones.
docs   book git fetch download new branches and data from a remote repository

docs   book git pull fetch from a remote repo and try to merge into the current branch

Git has two commands to update itself from a remote repository. git fetch will synchronize you with another repo, pulling down any data that you do not have locally and giving you bookmarks to where each branch on that remote was when you synchronized. These are called "remote branches" and are identical to local branches except that Git will not allow you to check them out - however, you can merge from them, diff them to other branches, run history logs on them, etc. You do all of that stuff locally after you synchronize.

The second command that will fetch down new data from a remote server is git pull. This command will basically run a git fetch immediately followed by a git merge of the branch on that remote that is tracked by whatever branch you are currently in. I personally don't much like this command - I prefer running fetch and merge seperately. Less magic, less problems. However, if you like this idea, you can read about it in more detail in the official docs.

Assuming you have a remote all set up and you want to pull in updates, you would first run git fetch [alias] to tell Git to fetch down all the data it has that you do not, then you would run git merge [alias]/[branch] to merge into your current branch anything new you see on the server (like if someone else has pushed in the meantime). So, if I were working on my Hello World project with several other people and I wanted to bring in any changes that had been pushed since I last connected, I would do something like this:

$ git fetch github
remote: Counting objects: 4006, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1322/1322), done.
remote: Total 2783 (delta 1526), reused 2587 (delta 1387)
Receiving objects: 100% (2783/2783), 1.23 MiB | 10 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1526/1526), completed with 387 local objects.
From github.com:schacon/hw
   8e29b09..c7c5a10  master     -> github/master
   0709fdc..d4ccf73  c-langs    -> github/c-langs
   6684f82..ae06d2b  java       -> github/java
 * [new branch]      ada        -> github/ada
 * [new branch]      lisp       -> github/lisp

I can see that since the last time I synchronized with this remote, five branches have been added or updated. The 'ada' and 'lisp' branches are new, where the 'master', 'c-langs' and 'java' branches have been updated. In this case, my team is pushing proposed updates to remote branches for review before they're merged into 'master'.

You can see the mapping that Git makes. The 'master' branch on the remote repository becomes a branch named 'github/master' locally. That way now I can merge the 'master' branch on that remote into my local 'master' branch by running git merge github/master. Or, I can see what new commits are on that branch by running git log github/master ^master. If your remote is named 'origin' it would be origin/master instead. Almost any command you would run using local branches you can use remote branches with too.

If you have more than one remote repository, you can either fetch from specific ones by running git fetch [alias] or you can tell Git to synchronize with all of your remotes by running git fetch --all.

In a nutshell you run git fetch [alias] to synchronize your repository with a remote repository, fetching all the data it has that you do not into branch references locally for merging and whatnot.
docs   book git push push your new branches and data to a remote repository

To share the cool commits you've done with others, you need to push your changes to the remote repository. To do this, you run git push [alias] [branch] which will attempt to make your [branch] the new [branch] on the [alias] remote. Let's try it by initially pushing our 'master' branch to the new 'github' remote we created earlier.

$ git push github master
Counting objects: 25, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (25/25), done.
Writing objects: 100% (25/25), 2.43 KiB, done.
Total 25 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:schacon/hw.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master

Pretty easy. Now if someone clones that repository they will get exactly what I have committed and all of its history.

What if I have a topic branch like the 'erlang' branch we created earlier and I just want to share that? You can just push that branch instead.

$ git push github erlang
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 652 bytes, done.
Total 6 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:schacon/hw.git
 * [new branch]      erlang -> erlang

Now when people clone or fetch from that repository, they'll get an 'erlang' branch they can look at and merge from. You can push any branch to any remote repository that you have write access to in this way. If your branch is already on the server, it will try to update it, if it is not, Git will add it.

The last major issue you run into with pushing to remote branches is the case of someone pushing in the meantime. If you and another developer clone at the same time, you both do commits, then she pushes and then you try to push, Git will by default not allow you to overwrite her changes. Instead, it basically runs git log on the branch you're trying to push and makes sure it can see the current tip of the server's branch in your push's history. If it can't see what is on the server in your history, it concludes that you are out of date and will reject your push. You will rightly have to fetch, merge then push again - which makes sure you take her changes into account.

This is what happens when you try to push a branch to a remote branch that has been updated in the meantime:

$ git push github master
To git@github.com:schacon/hw.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:schacon/hw.git'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes before pushing again.  See the 'Note about
fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.

You can fix this by running git fetch github; git merge github/master and then pushing again.

In a nutshell you run git push [alias] [branch] to update a remote repository with the changes you've made locally. It will take what your [branch] looks like and push it to be [branch] on the remote, if possible. If someone else has pushed since you last fetched and merged, the Git server will deny your push until you are up to date.
